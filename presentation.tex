\maketitle

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{What is the question?}
  How can you use extremal dynamics to train some kind of neural net?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{What? What's that?}
  Qualitative model of evolution: Bak-Sneppen model.
  \begin{figure}

  \end{figure}

  Rules of Bak-Sneppen model. How does it behave? Criticality. Self-organized criticality.

  Caveats: CR Shalizi, W Tozier, "A Simple Model of the Evolution of Simple Models of Evolution"

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Approaches Taken}
  Bak and Chialvo's model

  More abstract: extremal optimization

  Finally: Using $\tau$-EO on RBM, classification results

  \frametitle{$\tau$-EO on RBM}
  Why not feedforward? BM vs. Ising Model

  Locality: RBM

  Ising model learning dynamics

  %%% small picture of the low-energy spin glass, then the learning dynamics, and then zoomed in thing showing tau-EO is better

  %%% let's have a completely null graph here

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Task}
  See performance in machine learning task

  %%details of approach. specific target phenomenon. model network task setting, architecture, processing and learning algorithm, training environment
  Locality of fitness much better with RBM.
  %%% Figuring out applying the abstract EO algorithm to things. Note that the locality of fitness that the model requires is much easier to do in Boltzmann machine, decide to do RBM on those machines.

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Going forward}
  In report: look at created weights
  After class: use in a deep architecture
  After class: investigate with non-restricted BM's
